/**
 * @brief A note on ground truth track ID indexing - VirtualKitti starts their trackID's from 0 which is annoying
 * when handling the trackID's within a semantic/motion image mask since we normally expect the id's to be the exact pixel
 * values (where 0 is background).
 *
 * Instead we increase the actual trackID index to be the ground truth one (eg the one provided in the poses.txt file) + 1
 * so we can index the trackId's directly in the instance mask which will line up with the ones stored in the ground truth packets (after we have
 * +1 to their index)
